# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is a single-document resume. The primary content lives in `이력서.md`. There are no source code modules, tests, or build assets in the current layout.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
No build or test tooling is configured. If you add tooling later, document the exact commands here (for example, `npm test` for unit tests or `make build` for a PDF export pipeline).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use Markdown for content updates, following consistent heading levels and bullet formatting.
- Keep line lengths readable and avoid heavy nested lists.
- Preserve the existing Korean content and tone; add English only when it improves clarity.

## Testing Guidelines
There are no automated tests. If you add a formatter or validator (for example, a Markdown linter), include its command and any naming patterns for test files here.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
This repository is not currently a Git repository, so no commit history is available. If Git is initialized later, use short, descriptive commit summaries (for example, `Update career summary`), and ensure pull requests explain the change scope and include screenshots or PDF exports if you introduce a render pipeline.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Avoid committing sensitive personal data beyond what is intended for the resume. If you add build scripts or CI, keep configuration files minimal and document any required environment variables.
